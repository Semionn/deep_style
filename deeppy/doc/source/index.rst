DeepPy: Deep learning in Python
===============================

DeepPy is a `MIT licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ deep learning framework. DeepPy tries to add a touch of *zen* to deep learning as it

* Allows for *Pythonic* programming based on NumPy's :code:`ndarray`.
* Has a small and easily extensible codebase.
* Runs on CPU or Nvidia GPUs (thanks to `CUDArray
  <http://github.com/andersbll/cudarray>`_).
* Implements the following network architectures.

 * Feedforward networks
 * Convnets
 * Siamese networks
 * Autoencoders

**Note:** DeepPy is by no means a mature project and should be considered WIP.
