## CUDA-based NumPy

CUDArray is a CUDA-accelerated subset of the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library.
The goal of CUDArray is to combine the easy of development from the NumPy with the computational power of Nvidia GPUs in a lightweight and extensible framework.

CUDArray currently imposes many limitations in order to span a manageable subset of the NumPy library.
Nonetheless, it supports a neural network pipeline as demonstrated in the project [deeppy](http://github.com/andersbll/deeppy/).


### Features
- Drop-in replacement for NumPy (limitations apply).
- Fast array operations based on cuBLAS, cuRAND and cuDNN.
- (somewhat) Simple C++/CUDA wrapper based on Cython.
- Extends NumPy with specialized functions for neural networks.
- CPU fall-back when CUDA is not available.


### Installation
##### With CUDA back-end
First, you should consider specifying the following environment variables.
 - `INSTALL_PREFIX` (default: `/usr/local`). Path where to install libcudarray. For the Anaconda Python distribution this should be `/path/to/anaconda`.
 - `CUDA_PREFIX` (default: `/usr/local/cuda`). Path to the CUDA SDK organized in `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/` folders.
 - `CUDNN_ENABLED`. Set `CUDNN_ENABLED` to `1` to include cuDNN operations in `libcudarray`.

Then build and install libcudarray with

    make
    make install

Finally, install the cudarray Python package:

    python setup.py install


##### Without CUDA back-end
Install the cudarray Python package:

    python setup.py --without-cuda install


### Documentation
Please consult the [technical report][techreport] for now.
Proper documentation is on the TODO list.


### Contact
Feel free to report an [issue](http://github.com/andersbll/cudarray/issues) for feature requests and bug reports.

For a more informal chat, visit #cudarray on the [freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC network.

### TODO
- Proper transpose support,
- Add functionality for copying from NumPy array to existing CUDArray array.
- FFT module based on cuFFT.
- Unit tests!
- Add documentation to wiki.
- Windows/OS X support.
